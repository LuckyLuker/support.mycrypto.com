You can use both MyCrypto and Jaxx at the same time; both are client-side wallets that simply allow you to access your cryptocurrency on the blockchain. There is no need to "import" or "sweep" the assets from your Jaxx to a new wallet on MyCrypto.

Instead, use your Jaxx mnemonic phrase (12-word phrase) with the [MyCrypto desktop app](https://download.mycrypto.com/) to unlock your wallet, access the different addresses, and access any tokens or cryptocurrencies that were sent to any of your Jaxx addresses.

In order to see your ETC and interact with the ETC chain, you must first connect to an ETC node. Select "ETC (AUTO)" in the node switcher in the upper-right corner of MyCrypto.

When you want to see your ETH and send ETH or tokens, you simply change the node switcher back to "ETH (AUTO)".
