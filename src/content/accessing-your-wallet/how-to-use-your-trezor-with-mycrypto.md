The TREZOR is one of the best and easiest-to-use cryptocurrency hardware wallets out there It is available for purchase [here](https://shop.trezor.io/?offer_id=10&aff_id=1735). While the TREZOR supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies, this guide was specifically written for using Ether and ERC-20 tokens with MyCrypto.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  When connecting to your TREZOR, you do not generate a new wallet on MyCrypto. Your TREZOR is your wallet and you use your TREZOR device now to store and send Ether & tokens.
</div>


##  Initial Setup

1. **Plug your device into your computer** using the USB cable provided.

2. **Go to the URL displayed on your device.** You can use the buttons on your device to confirm/deny actions. ![](https://i.imgur.com/3krRHps.jpg) ![](https://i.imgur.com/nFt5R6p.jpg)

3. **Read all the information** shown to you on your TREZOR device and on the TREZOR initialization pages. Take your time—this device is going to be protecting your funds! ![](https://i.imgur.com/9XgRqKi.jpg) ![](https://i.imgur.com/WKuHHe3.jpg)

4. **Click the "Done, let's go!" button**.
    * You will then be redirected to [wallet.trezor.io](https://wallet.trezor.io/). This is where you will be setting up your TREZOR.

5. **Enter a name for your TREZOR.**

6. **Click "Continue."**

7. **Enter a new PIN** that you will use to access your TREZOR any time you want to access your wallets.
    *  Make sure this pin is hard to guess, so that others won't be able to get access to your TREZOR.
    *  If you are not sure how PINs work with the TREZOR, look [here](http://doc.satoshilabs.com/trezor-user/enteringyourpin.html) for more information.
    *  E.g., I want to set "8963" as a pin. This would mean that I have to click the lower-left button, then the middle-right button, then the lower-middle button, and finally the upper-left button. ![](https://i.imgur.com/A6zBzI3.jpg) ![](https://i.imgur.com/CJERk10.jpg)

8. **Re-enter the PIN you just created.**
    *  Be aware that the order of the numbers on the display of your TREZOR has changed, so you will have to click different buttons on your computer in order to enter the correct PIN. ![](https://i.imgur.com/jCWKVML.jpg) ![](https://i.imgur.com/zvs3p8A.jpg)

9. **Write down your recovery words.**
    *  The TREZOR will give you 24 random words that you will have to write down on the provided card that came in the box. These are the recovery words, also known as a seed phrase.
    *  You will have to use these words to restore your TREZOR in case it fails or you accidentally reset it.
    *  **Do not save these recovery words on your computer or take a photo of these words with your phone.** Doing so means you are just as unsafe as using a normal private key.
    *  Always write them down physically using pen and paper, and keep this paper safe. ![](https://i.imgur.com/27wfOOI.jpg) ![](https://i.imgur.com/DnPRxNY.jpg)

10. **Confirm your recovery words.**
    *  Once you've written down all of the words, it will ask you to confirm your recovery phrase in order to make sure that you've written them down correctly. ![](https://i.imgur.com/VwxBKXC.jpg)
